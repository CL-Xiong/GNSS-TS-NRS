**1. Requirements and Installation:**

Requirements

Users can run &#39;GNSS-TS-NRS&#39; under any operating system with MATLAB software installed. MATLAB2020b can be the most suitable version, if you have problems in this, you can contact [cl-xiong@qq.com](mailto:cl-xiong@qq.com) for help.

Installation

When MATLAB2020b has been installed on the computer, you can run this program as followsï¼š

- Download &#39;GNSS-TS-NRS&#39; software installation package
- Add &#39;GNSS-TS-NRS&#39; to the current path of MATLAB
- Run &quot;GNSS\_TS\_NRS.m&quot; or enter &quot;GNSS\_TS\_NRS&quot; on the command line to run the main interface of the software

&#39;GNSS-TS-NRS&#39; is a software package that can be used to process GNSS time series, composed of 5 modules:

- Time series noise reduction module:

Data input: Real times series and simulated times series (white noise &amp; colored noise);

Noise reduction algorithms: EMD, EEMD, three new algorithms (details in the paper);

Draw figures: Time series before and after noise reduction, IMFs, correlation coefficient.

Precision assessment: correlation coefficient Root mean square error (RMSE), signal noise ratio (SNR);

- Common mode error (CME) mitigation module:

Data input: Daily solution time series and coordinate

Algorithms: Stacking filtering, weighted stacking filtering, correlation weighted stacking filtering, distance weighted filtering, principal component analysis

Draw figures: Time series before and after CME mitigation, root mean square (RMS)

Precision assessment: RMS

- Time series plot and statistical analysis module:

The module can plot the following figure: RMS, correlation coefficient, power spectral density (PSD), norm and alpha-stable distribution fitting, Box-whisker plot and Violin plot.

- Time series processing tools module:

Outlier detection: Eliminate gross errors of observation data in batches, using n\*sigma, n\* IQR and MAD criterion

Format tool: convert the file format from CMONOC and SOPAC to the\*.mom in batches

- Nearby sites and find co-located sites module:

Nearby sites: Enter site latitude and longitude or site name to search for nearby sites.

Co-located sites: Search for collocated stations based on reference distance between GNSS stations and Tide gauge.

Also, the station database can be changed by user.
